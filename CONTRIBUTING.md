## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[QA-app Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_appblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <mitrasadat.mirshafie@ucalgary.ca>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <mitrasadat.mirshafie@ucalgary.ca>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest development branch in the repository.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for QA-app, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/blob/main/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mitramir55/QA_app/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most QA-app users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
